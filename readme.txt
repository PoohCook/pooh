This project is an attempt to learn the Go language by way of recreating an library that I created many years ago for a former employer.

The library is called Intervals and it provides an OO implmentation for a calculus around the creation and managments of data that is tied to a time definition (either points or Spans of time ) .


The project is currently rather infantile since I just learning Go and adaptiing a highly OO oriented concept such as this si a bit challenging within Go Lang.
